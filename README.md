G.L.O.S.S. – Global Language Organization & Shade System
- A world language mapping and color-coding system designed by Paulista for pre-World War linguistic diversity (ca. 1850–1900). It includes:

- A consistent color scheme that reflects language families and subfamilies, blending visual logic with linguistic relationships.

- A goal to visually represent dialectal richness before the standardization and extinction of many minority languages.

- Dropdown filters and table-based Google Sheet systems to manage and visualize language data.
